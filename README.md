//Hard-level automatic,multiplayer  TICTACTOE against AI
*The idea behind this side project was to create a small automated client side bot(or AI)
from SCRATCH using the basic principles of Javascript classes and async/await syntatic sugar without any framework at all
to order certain class methods.


*The major aim of this side project is to possibly determine most moves that can be made by
a human opponent of a tictactoe game and simply counter it to a stalemate.They're limitations to this
if the opponent starts a round and not the opponent.


*The bot offers a varying difficulty level to prevent walkover scenarios

*The difficulty posed by this bot can be reduced/increased in further versions by simply changing the ordering
in which bot(AI) uses.

*This is a useful project for understanding javascript classes 

*If you find this code useful,kindly drop a start.Any issues can be reported.
